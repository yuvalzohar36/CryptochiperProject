# The main function or script would include the encryption of the image,
# signing of the encrypted image, sending (which we assume happens off-script),
# verification of the signature, and finally decryption of the image if the signature is verified.

# Encrypt the image
# This should be done using the Two Fish encryption process you have
# Example: process_image("encrypt", key, iv, INPUT_IMG_PATH, ENCRYPTED_IMG_PATH)

# Sign the encrypted image
